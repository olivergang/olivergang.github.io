<p>Prospect park is a park in the center of Brooklyn and is about 512 acres in size.  It was built in July 1866.   The park  has a huge amount  of history as well as a  history with my family.
My father  grew up in Windsor Terrace which is located close to Prospect Park. When my father was a kid he would spend a lot of time in Prospect Park. So did my father’s brother's , my uncles and my cousins. It fascinates  me because  I am one of the only people from my family who did not grow up there on my father’s side.  It is in general an excellent park because many activities happen there and it gives people who live close by a lot of joy as well as people who do not live close to the park. There are so many different aspects of the park and activities.  Some of the activities in summer are day camps, great  music and picnicking. In the winter there are also fun activities such as ice skating and sledding .  There are areas that are peaceful and quiet and not too crowded.  I have been to many parties and picnics when I was younger of which I have great memories.<p/>
<p>There is also a lot of  wildlife such as ducks, turtles, birds, squirrels and many other animals. It is a great park to go for a walk or walk your dog or ride bikes and skateboard.
17 years ago  I was told my father had two choices . He had an apartment in Brooklyn  and my mother  had an apartment in the East Village.   He decided to live in Manhattan because he thought it would be interesting to raise a child in Manhattan. 17 years later and right now I wish I could have  been born and raised in Brooklyn like my cousins.  I could have  lived in Brooklyn and enjoyed  going to Prospect Park. It is like a vision of what life would be like if I was from Brooklyn and it seems great but is there still a  possibility?   I would not have liked Brooklyn if I grew up there but I will never know… I believe maybe that Prospect Park is the perfect place for me  to go if I am  tired of being in the city.  Also for me  to get away from the crowdedness and busy nature that most people experience in Manhattan like my father feels.</p>
It  could  help me be more connected to nature and  is  also a very  nice place to relax.
It is so huge that you can get lost there .There is also  the Smorgasburg board close there which my cousin took me to and  has good food.  I am very close with my father’s side of my family .I recently started hanging out with them a bit more and getting closer to my older cousins. Now my cousin Nick who lives in Brooklyn is tutoring me about once a week.   I have also  been on  facetime with my other cousin Ben from Brooklyn who is in Puerto Rico at the moment.  He is my father’s brother’s son and his mom has a house there.  I think my interest in Prospect Park has increased even now  because of the lack of my father being around.
I find his life very interesting. I guess I would like to understand him a bit  more.   I also have been understanding the world better through Prospect  Park.   Brooklyn connects all of New York because it is the most well known burrough.
